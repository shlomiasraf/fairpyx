    The main function.
    The tabu search aims to find the price vector P for which the gap between demand and supply
    will be as small as possible, thus allowing for an optimal and fair distribution of the courses.
    The search uses the neighbors function to find the optimal price vectors, and the score function
    that calculates the gap between demand and supply for a given price vector.
    The search continues as long as the SCORE is greater than the desired bound.
    At the end of the search, the vector will determine the optimal price, according to which the
    program will output the optimal course package for each student.
